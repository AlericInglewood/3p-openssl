GETTING STARTED
===============

Cloning
-------

This repository contains a submodule.
To clone this repository, first clone it as usual, then cd into
the cloned repository and execute the last two submodule more commands:

$ git clone https://github.com/AlericInglewood/3p-openssl.git 3p-openssl
$ cd 3p-openssl
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Updating openssl-git
--------------------

To update the submodule, simply cd into openssl-git and
treat it as a normal git repository.

$ cd openssl-git
$ git reset --hard		# Throw away all local changes!
				# (needed because all Makefiles were changed by running 'make depend')!
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git tag
$ git checkout OpenSSL_1_1_1

Register in the superproject that a different checkout is being used:

$ cd ..
$ correct_autobuild_xml
$ git diff autobuild.xml
$ git commit -am 'Updated submodule openssl-git to OpenSSL_1_1_1'


BUILDING
========

# To build the package:
cd 3p-openssl
autobuild install	# Install zlib
autobuild build
autobuild package

The produced package is directly usable for Singularity and
does not need conversion.
